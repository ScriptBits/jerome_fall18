<h2>Lesson 1: What is HTML?</h2>

<p>Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML. Why? HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. 
It's often the first language learned by marketers and designers and is core to front-end development work. If 
this is your first time touching code, we're excited for what you're about to create.</p>

<p>So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, 
text, or videos. Right-click on any page on the internet, choose “Inspect,” and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen.</p>

<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:</p>
<ul>
<li>A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.</li>
In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.</li>
HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through 
links, also known as hyperlinks. </li>
</ul>

<p>Learning HTML is the first step in creating websites, but even a bit of knowledge can help you 
inject code snippets into newsletter, blog or website templates. As you continue learning, you can 
layer HTML with CSS and JavaScript to create visually compelling and dynamic websites. But for now, 
we're going to focus on how to add and modify basic content on a page, like text, images, and videos. 
Don't worry if the websites look ugly — we're just getting started.</p>


<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open up the file “index_1-1.html” by double-clicking on the file name.  Right click anywhere on 
the opened “index_1-1.html” document.  Choose “view page source”.  With your mouse, select (highlight) 
all the code on the page.  Right click and choose “copy”.  Now, open the software program called “notepad”.  
Right click and choose “paste”.  Next, go to the “file” menu option found at the top of your notepad 
window.  Choose “save as”.  Before you click the “save” button, you must do 4 things:  1) make sure to 
choose the “UTF-8” option found in the “encoding menu” (pull-down menu).  2) choose “All Files” in the 
”Save as type” menu. 3) In the “File name” box, type in the name of your file “1-1_index.html”.  4) In 
the very top box of your Save-as window, choose your “WebDev/Module-1” folder on your Google drive.  Now, 
click “save”.</li>
<li>Change the text “my name” found between &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;.  Then go to “file” and “save as” again.  
Repeat your previous actions to save your .html document.  This document should be in your Google 
drive folder (CSA/Module-1)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Question</h3>
<ol>
<li>Why would raw text need a structure?</li>
<li>Why does the browser need information about the type of raw text it will display?</li>
<li>Doesn’t CSS define presentation of web content?</li>
</ol>
