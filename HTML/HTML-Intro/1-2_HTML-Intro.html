<h2>Lesson 2: HTML Anatomy</h2>


<p>HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content. Let's 
take a look at how they're written.</p>

<p>The diagram (below) displays an HTML paragraph element. As we can see, the paragraph element is 
made up of one opening tag(&lt;p&gt;), the content (“Hello World!” text), and a closing tag (&lt;/p&gt;). A 
tag and the content between it is called an HTML element. There are many tags that we can use to 
organize and display text and other types of content, like images.
</p>

<p>Let's quickly review each part of the element pictured:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML element (or simply, element) — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML 
tags and the text or media it contains.</li>
<li>HTML Tag — the element name, surrounded by an opening (<) and closing (>) angle bracket.</li>
<li>Opening Tag — the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded 
by opening and closing angle brackets.</li>
<li>Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing 
tags of an HTML element.</li>
<li>Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward 
slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Study the diagram above to learn about the anatomy of HTML syntax. When you're done, 
continue to the next exercise.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li>What type of content might an HTML element contain?</li>
<li>Do tags themselves count as content?</li>
<li>Is there a sentence or a word element?</li>
</ol>
