<h2>Lesson 4: Page Structure</h2>

<p>Open the file <a href="https://rawgit.com/ke5urh/jerome_fall18/master/HTML/HTML-Intro/1-4_index.html”>"1-4_index.html"</a>. 
  Open the source code for 1-4_index.html by right-clicking on the page and selecting "view page source".  Briefly study the source code.</p>


<p>HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships. As you saw in the last exercise, we placed 
&lt;p&gt; tags within &lt;body&gt; tags. When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that 
element. The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.</p>

<p>In the example above, the &lt;p&gt; element is nested inside the &lt;body&gt; element. The &lt;p&gt; element is considered a 
child of the &lt;body&gt; element, and the &lt;body&gt; element is considered the parent. You can also see that we've added 
two spaces of indentation (using the spacebar) for better readability.</p>


<p>Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, 
and beyond. The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendant elements is known as hierarchy.</p>

<p>Let's consider a more complicated example that uses some new tags:</p>

<img src="https://rawgit.com/ke5urh/jerome_fall18/master/HTML/images/1-4b_PageStructure.jpg" alt="three generations">

<p>In this example, the &lt;body&gt; element is the parent of the &lt;div&gt; element. Both the &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt; elements are 
children of the &lt;div&gt; element. Because the &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt; elements are at the same level, they are considered siblings 
and are both grandchildren of the &lt;body&gt; element.</p>

<p>Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can inherit behavior and styling from their 
parent element. You'll learn more about webpage hierarchy in when you start digging into CSS.</p>
