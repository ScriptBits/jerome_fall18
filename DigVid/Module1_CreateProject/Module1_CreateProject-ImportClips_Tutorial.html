    <h2>What you'll need</h2>
    <p>While watching the videos, the narrator will ask you to open lesson files.  In the same folder where you found this instruction page, there is a
      folder labeled "Module#_MediaFiles".  In that folder, there are filenames ending with ".prproj"; you will use these .prproj files during your lesson.</p>

      <br><br>

      <h2>Step 1: Create a project</h2>
      <p>During this first step, you will see that you can either create a new project or open an existing one.
        During this lesson, you will need to access the Adobe Premiere project file </p>
        <a href="Module1_MediaFiles\create-project-import-media-step1.prproj">create-project-import-media-step1.prproj</a>

          <h3>What you learned: Create a project</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Open a Premiere Pro project file by double-clicking it, or by clicking <i>Open Project</i> in the Start screen and selecting a file.</li>
              <li>To create a new project file, click New Project in the Start screen. Choose a name, browse to choose a location
                for the project file, and click OK.</li>
                <li>To import media files using the Media Browser panel, browse to the files you’d like to import, select the
                  clips you want to work with in Premiere Pro, right-click one of the selected clips, and choose Import. Once
                  the media is imported, you’re ready to edit.</li>
                  <li>As you edit, be sure to save your work (choose File > Save) periodically.</li>
                  <li>To close your project, choose File > Close Project.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <h2>Step 2: Workspace overview</h2>
                <p>Understand the basic user interface to become familiar with Premiere Pro.
                  During this lesson, you will need to access the Adobe Premiere project file
                  <a href="Module1_MediaFiles\create-project-import-media-step2.prproj">create-project-import-media-step2.prproj</a>

                  <h3>What you learned: Panels and Workspaces</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Panels: Each panel has a specific purpose. You can resize or reposition them. All panels are accessible in the Window menu.</li>
                      <li>Workspaces: Preset layouts with panels displayed that are useful for particular tasks, such as editing video or
                        working on audio. To reset a workspace, choose Window > Workspace > Reset to Saved Layout.</li>
                        <li>Blue highlight: Only one panel at a time will have a blue highlight, indicating that it is the active panel.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <br>

                      <h2>Step 3: Import media</h2>
                      <p>When you import videos into Premiere Pro, they appear as clips (shortcuts to your media files) in the Project panel.
                        During this lesson, you will need to access the Adobe Premiere project file
                        <a href="Module1_MediaFiles\create-project-import-media-step3.prproj">create-project-import-media-step3.prproj</a>
                      </p>
                      <br><br>

                        <h3>What you learned: Import media</h2>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Use the Media Browser panel to locate and import your media files. To preview a video in the Source Monitor,
                              double-click it. To import media files, select them and right-click on them to choose Import.</li>
                              <li>Bins allow you to organize your clips in the same way that you might organize files in folders on your
                                computer. To create a new bin, click the New Bin button in the Project panel.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <br>


                              <h2>Step 4: Build a sequence</h2>

                              <p>Most of the creative work in Premiere Pro happens when you build a sequence of clips that play, one after
                                another. You’ll need to create a sequence before you can add clips to it.
                                During this lesson, you will need to access the Adobe Premiere project file
                                <a href="Module1_MediaFiles\create-project-import-media-step4.prproj">create-project-import-media-step4.prproj</a>
                              </p>

                                <h3>What you learned: Build a sequence</h2>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>When you create a sequence, it appears in the Project panel along with your clips. You can create as many
                                      sequences as you want in the same project.</li>
                                      <li>To create a new sequence, drag one or more clips into the empty Timeline panel, or select one or more clips
                                        in the Project panel, right-click on the selection and choose New Sequence from Clip.</li>
                                        <li>Add more clips by dragging them into the Timeline panel.</li>
                                        <li>To remove a clip from the sequence, select it and press Backspace (Windows) or Delete (macOS). If you select
                                          clips and press Shift+Delete (Windows) or Shift+fn+Delete (macOS), they will be removed without leaving a gap in the sequence.</li>
                                          <ul>
